disjoint_set_union:it is data structure that provides an efficent way to perform two main operations on the collection of disjoint set
1)merging two sets
2)determining whether two elements part of the same set
it is particularly used for solving problems involving connected components such as graphic theory and image segmentation
A={1,2,3,4,5}
b={6,7,8}
here A and B are two disjoint set
